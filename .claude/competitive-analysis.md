## Market Gaps We Fill

### Gap 1: Subcircuit Focus
**Problem**: Existing platforms focus on individual components or complete projects. There's no middle ground.

**Our Solution**: Reusable subcircuits (power supplies, amplifiers, interfaces) that are bigger than components but smaller than full projects.

### Gap 2: Copy/Paste Workflow
**Problem**: Downloading KiCad projects from GitHub means cloning repos, extracting files, importing into your project.

**Our Solution**: Copy S-expression → Paste in KiCad. Done in 5 seconds.

### Gap 3: Discoverability
**Problem**: Finding a "USB-C power delivery circuit" on GitHub means searching repos, reading READMEs, hoping someone made exactly what you need.

**Our Solution**: Search by function, component, or tag. Interactive preview before copying. Metadata extraction (component lists, interfaces).

### Gap 4: KiCad-Native
**Problem**: Multi-CAD platforms (SnapEDA, Ultra Librarian) require format conversion. Results are often imperfect.

**Our Solution**: KiCad S-expressions natively. No conversion, no loss of fidelity.

### Gap 5: Open Source Friendly
**Problem**: Proprietary platforms (EasyEDA, Altium 365) lock users into ecosystems. Closed-source tools don't align with open hardware ethos.

**Our Solution**: Open source platform, open file formats, open licenses. Aligns with KiCad and open hardware communities.
