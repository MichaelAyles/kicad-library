# Comments System Implementation

## ✅ Completed

The comments system has been fully implemented with the following features:

### Database Schema
- **circuit_comments table** - Stores all comments with support for threaded replies
- **comment_likes table** - Tracks user likes on comments
- **Triggers** - Auto-update likes_count and comment_count
- **RLS Policies** - Secure row-level access control
- **Migration file** - `supabase/migration-add-comments.sql`

### Backend API (`src/lib/comments.ts`)
- `getCircuitComments()` - Fetch all comments with nested replies
- `createComment()` - Create new comment or reply
- `updateComment()` - Edit comment content
- `deleteComment()` - Remove a comment
- `toggleCommentLike()` - Like/unlike a comment
- `getCommentCount()` - Get total comment count for a circuit

### Frontend Components
- **Comment** (`src/components/Comment.tsx`) - Individual comment with actions (like, reply, edit, delete)
- **CommentForm** (`src/components/CommentForm.tsx`) - Form for creating new comments/replies
- **CommentList** (`src/components/CommentList.tsx`) - Container that displays all comments with threading

### Features Implemented
✅ Threaded replies (up to 3 levels deep)
✅ Like/unlike comments
✅ Edit own comments (with "edited" indicator)
✅ Delete own comments
✅ Real-time character counter (5000 max)
✅ User avatars
✅ Relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")
✅ Authentication checks
✅ Loading and error states
✅ Empty state message
✅ Responsive design

### Integration
- Comments section added to circuit detail page (`src/app/circuit/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Appears below the attribution section

## 🔧 Setup Required

To activate the comments system, you need to:

### 1. Run Database Migration

Execute the migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# File location: supabase/migration-add-comments.sql
```

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migration-add-comments.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute

This will create:
- `circuit_comments` table
- `comment_likes` table
- `comment_count` column on `circuits` table
- All necessary triggers and RLS policies

### 2. Verify Tables

Check that the tables were created:

```sql
-- Check comments table
SELECT * FROM circuit_comments LIMIT 1;

-- Check likes table
SELECT * FROM comment_likes LIMIT 1;

-- Verify triggers exist
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%comment%';
```

### 3. Test Authentication

Make sure users can authenticate (already set up with GitHub OAuth):
- Log in with a GitHub account
- User profile should be created automatically
- Check `profiles` table has your user

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once the database migration is complete, test these features:

### Basic Commenting
- [ ] Create a top-level comment on a circuit
- [ ] Verify comment appears immediately
- [ ] Check character counter works (max 5000)
- [ ] Verify timestamp shows "just now" or "X seconds ago"
- [ ] Check user avatar and username display correctly

### Threading
- [ ] Reply to a comment (1st level)
- [ ] Reply to a reply (2nd level)
- [ ] Reply to a 2nd level reply (3rd level)
- [ ] Verify "Reply" button disappears at max depth (3 levels)
- [ ] Check indentation works correctly

### Likes
- [ ] Like a comment (heart should fill and count increases)
- [ ] Unlike a comment (heart empties, count decreases)
- [ ] Check like persists after page refresh
- [ ] Verify you can't like your own comment multiple times

### Editing
- [ ] Edit your own comment
- [ ] Verify "edited" indicator appears
- [ ] Cancel edit (content reverts)
- [ ] Try to edit someone else's comment (should not see edit button)

### Deleting
- [ ] Delete your own comment
- [ ] Confirm deletion dialog appears
- [ ] Verify comment disappears after deletion
- [ ] Check that replies are also deleted (CASCADE)

### Authentication
- [ ] Try to comment while logged out (should show login message)
- [ ] Log in and verify you can now comment
- [ ] Log out and verify actions are disabled

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Submit empty comment (should show error)
- [ ] Submit comment with only whitespace (should show error)
- [ ] Submit exactly 5000 characters (should work)
- [ ] Try to submit 5001 characters (should be blocked by maxLength)
- [ ] Test on mobile (responsive design)
- [ ] Test with dark mode enabled

## 📊 Database Monitoring

Check comment activity in Supabase:

```sql
-- Get total comment count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM circuit_comments;

-- Get most commented circuits
SELECT
  c.title,
  c.comment_count
FROM circuits c
ORDER BY c.comment_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Get most liked comments
SELECT
  cc.content,
  cc.likes_count,
  p.username
FROM circuit_comments cc
JOIN profiles p ON cc.user_id = p.id
ORDER BY cc.likes_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Get recent activity
SELECT
  cc.content,
  p.username,
  cc.created_at
FROM circuit_comments cc
JOIN profiles p ON cc.user_id = p.id
ORDER BY cc.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 🎨 UI Customization

The comments UI uses Tailwind CSS and can be customized:

- **Colors**: Uses `primary`, `muted`, `red-500` for likes
- **Spacing**: Max depth is 3 levels with `ml-8` indentation
- **Avatars**: 8x8 (w-8 h-8) circular avatars
- **Max characters**: 5000 (configurable in `CONSTRAINT content_length`)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- [ ] @mentions with notifications
- [ ] Comment notifications (email/in-app)
- [ ] Markdown support for rich text
- [ ] Report/flag inappropriate comments
- [ ] Admin moderation tools
- [ ] Comment search
- [ ] Sort options (newest, oldest, most liked)
- [ ] Pinned comments (by circuit owner)
- [ ] Comment reactions (beyond just likes)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **Max nesting**: 3 levels to prevent deep threading issues
- **No real-time updates**: Page refresh needed to see others' comments
- **No markdown**: Plain text only (could add with react-markdown)
- **No notifications**: Users won't be notified of replies

## 🔒 Security

The comments system implements proper security:

- **RLS Policies**: Users can only edit/delete their own comments
- **Authentication**: Must be logged in to comment/like
- **SQL Injection**: Protected by Supabase's prepared statements
- **XSS**: Content is escaped by React
- **Character limits**: Enforced at database level (CHECK constraint)

**Status**: Implementation complete, awaiting database migration to go live! 🎉
